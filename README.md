# Dice-Game
Building a small dice game which will implement Javascript

This goal of this project is simply to roll the dice everytime the page is refreshed, and whichever player wins, it should display the winners
message on top of the screen replacing the "Refresh Me" text

This is only the third project in my javascript learning experience. I began slowly with projects just focusing on html and css, and now this is
the first project that will include functionality using javascript.
